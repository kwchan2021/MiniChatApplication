# Mini Chat Application

An chat app built with python.

Steps to run the app:

Step 1: Use Terminal to run the "irc_server.py" file in order to host the server of the chat app
Step 2: Use a few Terminals to run the "irc_client.py" file separately in order to have an interface to send and receive messages

Remarks: Ensure that the host and the port numbers are the same in both the server and the client side in order to chat via the app successfully
